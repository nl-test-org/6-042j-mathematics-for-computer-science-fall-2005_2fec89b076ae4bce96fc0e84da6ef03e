This is an introductory course in Discrete Mathematics oriented toward Computer Science and Engineering. The course divides roughly into thirds:

1.  Fundamental Concepts of Mathematics: Definitions, Proofs, Sets, Functions, Relations
2.  Discrete Structures: Modular Arithmetic, Graphs, State Machines, Counting
3.  Discrete Probability Theory

A version of this course from a previous term was also taught as part of the [Singapore-MIT Alliance](http://web.mit.edu/sma/) (SMA) programme as course number SMA 5512 (Mathematics for Computer Science).
